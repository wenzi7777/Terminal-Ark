*Terminal Ark is a text-driven sci-fi RPG designed for a relaxed experience suitable for long-term play.*

Players can manage their characters, squads, and equipment, progress through story chapters, and explore dungeons. The game supports both solo play and cooperative play with up to two other players, featuring card-based, turn-based combat. Battle outcomes are closely tied to character builds, equipment affixes, and tactical decisions—every choice can influence the flow of combat.

The game supports long-term offline progression (AFK). Even without staying online for extended periods, players can continue to accumulate resources, materials, and experience. Upon returning, they can further develop their progression through crafting, trading, equipment enhancement, and upgrade modules, gradually shaping their own unique growth path. Equipment comes in multiple rarities with randomized affix combinations, significantly affecting character roles and combat strategies.

In addition, the game features a guild-like system called the “Terminal User Network,” allowing players to team up with like-minded companions. During dungeon exploration, players can also make use of the “Support Hero” system to borrow powerful heroes from other players, providing crucial assistance on their epic journeys.

The world contains a large number of randomly generated enemies, dungeons, and exploration locations. A significant portion of this content is derived from templates and data contributed by the player community, allowing the world to continuously expand and remain fresh. The game also offers multilingual chat channels, enabling all players to communicate, share, and discuss in a friendly and open environment.

Whether you enjoy deep optimization, immersive worldbuilding, or simply logging in occasionally to check on your progress, Terminal Ark provides a space where you can play at your own pace, relax, and grow steadily.
