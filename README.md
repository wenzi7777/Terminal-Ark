*Terminal Ark is a completely free, text-based RPG.*

Navigate a cyberpunk-inspired world through an ever-evolving UI, where commands and interactive modules guide your journey. Every click pushes the story forward, revealing systems, choices, and consequences hidden beneath the surface of the Ark.

Terminal Ark is designed for relaxed, long-term play. It features AFK tasks, steady progression, equipment management, and crafting systems that reward both active and passive playstyles. The world is filled with a vast pool of randomly generated enemies, dungeons, and locations—many of which are built from user-contributed templates and data.

Whether you prefer to min-max, explore lore, or simply check in from time to time, Terminal Ark offers a space to unwind, explore, and grow at your own pace.
